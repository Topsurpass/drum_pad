# Mini Drum pad Application
**Tagline: Creating beats, one key at a time!**
## Introduction
The Mini Drum pad Application is a software project that aims to create a simple and interactive drum pad, allowing users to produce beats using designated keyboard keys. The application will provide an intuitive user interface, offering a fun and creative way for music enthusiasts to experiment with drum sounds.
## Team Members
- Olowosuyi Temitope
- Favour Edubio
## Technologies
The project will be developed using the following technologies:
- React: For building the user interface and managing components efficiently.
- Redux: For state management, ensuring a consistent and predictable application state.
- HTML: For structuring the web page and content.
- CSS: For styling the user interface and enhancing the visual appeal.
- JavaScript: For implementing the application logic and interactivity.
## Project Objectives
- Create an easy-to-use drum pad application that appeals to beginners.
- Allow users to produce drum sounds by pressing specific keyboard keys (Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C).
- Implement a visually appealing user interface to enhance the user experience.
- Enable users to record and playback their drum beats for creative purposes. 
## Features
The Mini Drum pad Application will include the following key features:
- Sound Mapping: Assigning specific drum sounds to each of the limited keyboard keys (Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C).
- Real-time Playback: Producing drum sounds in real-time as users press the corresponding keyboard keys.
- User-friendly Interface: Designing an intuitive and visually appealing interface for easy navigation and usage.
- Record and Playback: Allowing users to record their drum beats and play them back for review and creative exploration.
- Sound Library: Including a selection of drum sounds to choose from and the option to add custom sounds.
## Data Population
The application will not require a backend or database for data storage. All necessary data for the drum pad, such as sound samples and configuration settings, will be stored directly within the application.
## Branching and Merging Process
For version control and collaboration, our team will follow the GitHub flow:
- Main Branch: The 'main' branch will contain the stable and production-ready code.
- Feature Branches: Each team member will create a new branch for their feature development.
- Pull Requests: After completing a feature, the team member will create a pull request to merge their branch into 'main.'
- Code Reviews: Pull requests will be reviewed by another team member before merging.
- Continuous Integration: We will use automated testing and code checks to ensure code quality before merging.
## Testing Approach
For testing, we will employ the following tools and processes:
- Integration Testing: Conducting integration tests to ensure the seamless interaction of different components.
- User Testing: Involving potential users to perform usability testing and gather feedback for improvements.
## Deployment Strategy
For deployment, we will use a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) approach. Upon each successful merge into the 'main' branch, an automated CI/CD will trigger the deployment process to the hosting environment.
## Similar Products
Some similar drum pad applications that currently exist are:
- HTML5 Drum pad: This is a simple drum pad web application built with HTML5 and JavaScript. It allows users to create beats using the keyboard keys.
### `Difference:` Our Mini Drum pad will focus on a limited set of keyboard keys for simplicity.
- React Drum pad: Another drum pad application built with React, Redux, and Web Audio API.
### `Difference`: Our Mini Drum pad will have a unique keyboard layout and focus on a simple user interface.
## Challenges
The primary challenges our project will experience due to time constraints and other factors include:
- Limited Keyboard Input: Our drum pad will be designed using only the specified keyboard keys (Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C).
- Inability to get access to real keyboard sounds to populate our app.
- Our app is designed for only beginners due to its limited features.
## Conclusion
The Mini Drum pad Application will offer a creative and enjoyable experience for users to produce their drum beats using a minimal set of keyboard keys. By combining the power of React, Redux, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we aim to deliver a user-friendly, feature-rich, and aesthetically pleasing application that sparks the musical inspiration of users.
